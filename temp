japan is one of the safest countries in the world.
Japanese traveler sometimes don't understund about it.
I have a special example.
This is my friend's real story.
He is dentist.
Last year, hi went to France to buy some machine which he use in his hospital.
So he had much money about 300,0000yen when he arrived at airport in France.
He left the airport to go th hotel, but one police car followed his car and police officerstopped his car.
Police officer stoke friends money as if police officer had checked friend's trunk.
They were not fake pilice officer. But they stole friend's money.
