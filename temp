Japan is one of the safest countries in the world.
Japanese travelers sometimes don't understand about it.

I have a special example.
This is my friend's real story.
He is a dentist.
Last year, he went to France to buy some machine which he wanted to use in his hospital.
So he had much money, about 3 million yen, when he arrived at the airport in France.
He left the airport to go to the hotel, but one police car followed and stopped his car.
The police officers stole my friend's money.
They were not fake police officers. But they stole my friend's money.
